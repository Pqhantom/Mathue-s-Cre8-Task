Create Task Collab

Idea: To make a simple trivia game that randomly chooses questions from a list and perhaps provide the user with multiple answer options. 

# Requirements ``for code lol``
- instructions for the user  ~~because they are dum~~
- use at least one list
  - questions
  - answer
- at least one procedure with:
  <br>``what is a procedure?``
  - procedure name
  - return type ``(if used?)``
  - one or more parameters
- algorithm that includes:
  - sequencing
  - selection
  - iteration
- calls to the procedure?
- an input and output
